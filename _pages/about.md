I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto. I am a member of the Computer Systems and Networks group and my advisor is Professor Bianca Schroeder.

My current research focuses on the design and implementation of computer systems, especially large scale systems and storage systems, while focusing on their reliability aspect.
